            </div>
            <span><p>This project was assigned to me by the University of Auckland School of Environment.
                The aim was to take disparate geographic information and transform it into something that was useful to the layman.
                In order to achieve this the data had to be gathered, processed and displayed accurately, briefly and clearly -
                in a manner that is pleasing to the eye. The submission format required was an A3 Poster PDF,
                though I am currently experimenting with a few APIs that might allow me to render it online!</p></span>

            <div class="years">
                <h4><b>Execution</b></h4>
                <span><h4>ArcMap and ArcScene</h4></span>
                <p>Using University licenced copies of the Arc Series from ESRI, I undertook the analysis in line with
                    project requirements. Let me say right now that I LOVE ArcGIS, I'm a huge fan of the software set that
                    ESRI produces and particularly enjoy the documentation - it is incredibly easy to commit a naive solution
                    to a problem within the due date, then refine that solution at a later stage using the extensive documentation, as well as online community help available.</p>
                <p>To complete this project I used the Spatial Analyst extension for ArcMap and ArcScene. I was supplied with a
                    study extent shapefile, as well as a Digitel Elevation Model (Probably collected with a Satellite rather
                    than LIDAR equipped aircraft). I was also given low resolution aerial imagery from one of the Universitys' other projects.</p>

                <p>In order to complete the project I needed to figure out where the best places within the Dusky Sound
                    (in the South Island of New Zealand) were, to place motion activated surveillance cameras that would capture Moose activity!</p>

                <p>For the purposes of this project, Moose only lived in the study extent, within the following bounds:

                <p>Below 500 metres in elevation.</p>
                <p>On slopes less than 7.5 degrees.</p>
                <p>Within 200 metres of a river.</p>
                <p>   On South Westerly, Southern and South Eastern Slope Aspects</p>

                <p>ArcMap was my go-to tool, particularly with the functions that I could access via Spatial Analyst.
                    To solve the problem, I used the Slope, Aspect, Euclidean Distance, Reclassify, Mosaic and Raster Calculator
                    tools that were part of the Spatial Analyst Extension</p>

                <p>The First step was to find more accurate data! I was supplied with a 15m Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
                    and decided quickly that to get an edge on the competition I could find my own, more accurate DEM.
                    I reached out using Twitter and Google, a member of the Koordinates team very kindly helped me out and
                    I soon downloaded an updated DEM. The DEM came in four parts covering more area than I needed,
                    so I merged the parts into a mosaic and clipped it to the study extent I was given. I coloured it and
                    made a basic map to show the user how rough and unpleasant this ground is.</p>
                <a class="rightarrow" href="images/mooseHuntProject/8mDEM_Export.jpg"><span> </span></a>

                <a href="images/mooseHuntProject/DEM-River-Reclass.jpg"><img src="images/mooseHuntProject/DEM-River-Reclass.jpg"></a>
                <p>Next I calculated Euclidean Distance (this marks all pixels within a set distance of a feature, a certain colour)
                    to render all land within 200 metres of all rivers within the target area blue. I reclassifed my DEM to show land
                    above 500 metres in elevation as red (Moose can't live here as per the spec) and all land below 500 metres as green
                    (Hypothesis: All Dusky Sound Moose have pocket altimeters that announce them to Haast Eagles and Giant Moa should
                    they stray above the 500m elevation cut off ;). With these visualisations done, I overlaid the two, and found that
                    they were exceedingly ugly and not very clear, I'm sure you will agree.</p>

                <p>I decided to shelve the ugliness problem and instead began integrating the rest of the data needed to reduce the target area fully.
                    This map shows the slopes in the area, reclassified to indicate slopes where our elusive Moose mates can and can't live.
                    As per the spec, 7.5 degrees and under was required for a successful return.</p>

                <p>Next up was Aspect analysis. It was a pretty simple step to use the Aspect tool and then reclassify the results.
                    The trick now that all of my data was processed, was to integrate everything in something that was clear and intuitive - but not too ugly.</p>
                <a class="rightarrow" href="images/mooseHuntProject/Aspecr-Reclass.jpg"><span> </span></a>

                <a href="images/mooseHuntProject/semi-final.jpg"><img src="images/mooseHuntProject/semi-final.jpg"></a>
                <p>This somewhat semi-final map layout took some time to test and adjust. I turned off some data so that negative
                    results could not be seen, and fiddled with transparency to make everything work. It's less ugly, but not good enough.
                    Fortunately all of these maps were for my own use and not primarily customer facing, so I could handle that later.</p>

                <p> Using the raster calculator tool, my next step was to combine all of my layers into one.
                    This is where the use of the reclassify tool stood me in good stead. I had reclassified my data as ones and zeroes -
                    binary indicating whether this place did, or did not fit one of the moose habitat criteria.
                    The raster calculator gave me output categories between zero and four, four being all conditions met
                    and zero being no conditions met. The project required that all criteria be met, so I reclassified the
                    layer as a one or a zero. What previously was four, became one, everything else became a zero.
                    From there it was simple enough to display and understand. Here is the final habitat where moose can live in the Dusky Sound!</p>

                <p>During the process, I also draped these images on top of the DEM using ArcScene,
                    to get a quick and dirty 3D visualisation of the area - I eyeballed the results to make sure there wasn't any
                    immediately obvious errors in my analysis.</p>

                <p>Fortunately, I also had access to some NZTM Topo50 GeoTiffs (Super High Quality Maps stored without legends,
                    for use in applications like this) that I draped, to gain a second look at the target area.</p>

        <p>Once the viewshed analysis was complete, I set the viewshed, moose habitat and camera locations down one by one.
            I used ArcMaps' layout view rather than the data view and added the appropriate symbology. The result,
            after a bit of tweaking resulted in the maps you see below! These are the final products I submitted.</p>

        <p>My finished maps successfully rendered, I had extra time on my hands before the deadline so I loaded up ArcScene.
            This is a 3D visualisation program that I used to make sure my cameras weren't in silly places - though my eye for
            maps has been pretty well trained by the army, mistakes do happen!</p>
        <p>I draped NZTopo50 maps on top of my DEM, as well as taking some images with the DEM itself (Hopefully it's obvious which is which!)
            The black dots in these images are the camera locations, with green shading marking places that can be seen by the camera.
            The yellow shading indicates viable moose habitat!</p>
