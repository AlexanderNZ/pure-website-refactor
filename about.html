            <p>I've done some pretty cool stuff in the short time I've had, and I'm proud of what I've achieved.</p>

            <h3>Army Experience</h3>

            <p>I joined the Army straight out of high school, in January 2009. Basically I did it because at that stage
                I had no idea what I wanted to
                do with my life - and for me that was an unsettling feeling. At the time, I felt like it was a better
                option compared to enrolling in
                University, with no idea what line of study I wanted to pursue. In hindsight it was the second best
                decision I've ever made.</p>

            <p>I met awesome people, gained discipline and adaptability, learned how to function under pressure and a
                whole lot more besides. I also
                became part of a team, and learned how important team is. The Army taught me that team is an extension
                of family (that's an IS-A
                relationship rather than HAS-A)</p>

            <p>On top of that, the Army sent me a lot of places to do a lot of things. The photos of Afghanistan that
                are scattered around my website,
                were all taken by me! My camera was a potato, even for the time, but I think most of the photos turned
                out okay!</p>

            <p>If you have any questions about my time in the Army, ask away - there are contact links at the bottom of
                the page</p>

            <h3>University</h3>

            <p>Having sorted out a long term plan, in 2013 I decided it was time to leave the army.</p>

            <p>I enrolled in a Bachelor of Science, Majoring in Geography and Computer Science. I chose this path
                because during my time in the army I
                developed a healthy respect for nature and a love of the outdoors. I want to make sure that, whatever I
                do, I still make time to enjoy
                the wilderness around me.</p>

            <p>That being said, I also love technology, and believe that technology is going to be of ever increasing
                importance in the future. The
                topics I've found most enjoyable at university so far, have been things like web development and design,
                distributed computing and of
                course big data and the visualisation of that data. I find algorithms really interesting - my after
                hours learning is mainly focused
                around algorithms at the moment and I would love to work somewhere that I could build my skills in
                things like that.</p>

            <p>These two majors are very different fields, but they have a cool intersection, and that is Geographic
                Information Systems (GIS). Of all
                things, I'm the most passionate about GIS. I used it extensively in the army and am a firm believer in
                it's awesomeness. My dream job
                would be to work at a place where I could put big data on to a map and improve people's lives with the
                analysis that comes from that.
                That being said, I have a lot of dream jobs, I'm very open to negotiation!</p>
