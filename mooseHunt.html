            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>This project was assigned to me by the University of Auckland School of Environment. The aim was to take
                disparate geographic
                information and transform it into something that was useful to the layman. In order to achieve this the
                data had to be gathered,
                processed and displayed accurately, briefly and clearly - in a manner that is pleasing to the eye. The
                submission format required was
                an A3 Poster PDF, though I am currently experimenting with a few APIs that might allow me to render it
                online!</p>

            <h3>Execution</h3>

            <p>Using University licenced copies of the Arc Series from ESRI, I undertook the analysis in line with
                project requirements. Let me say
                right now that I LOVE ArcGIS, I'm a huge fan of the software set that ESRI produces and particularly
                enjoy the documentation - it is
                incredibly easy to commit a naive solution to a problem within the due date, then refine that solution
                at a later stage using the
                extensive documentation, as well as online community help available.</p>

            <p>To complete this project I used the Spatial Analyst extension for ArcMap and ArcScene. I was supplied
                with a study extent shapefile,
                as well as a Digitel Elevation Model (Probably collected with a Satellite rather than LIDAR equipped
                aircraft). I was also given low
                resolution aerial imagery from one of the other University projects.</p>

            <p>In order to complete the project I needed to figure out where the best places within the Dusky Sound (in
                the South Island of New
                Zealand) were, to place motion activated surveillance cameras that would capture Moose activity!For the
                purposes of this project,
                Moose only lived in the study extent, within the following bounds:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Below 500 metres in elevation.</li>
                <li>On slopes less than 7.5 degrees.</li>
                <li>Within 200 metres of a river.</li>
                <li>On South Westerly, Southern and South Eastern Slope Aspects</li>
            </ol>

            <p>ArcMap was my go-to tool, particularly with the functions that I could access via Spatial Analyst. To
                solve the problem, I used the
                Slope, Aspect, Euclidean Distance, Reclassify, Mosaic and Raster Calculator tools that were part of the
                Spatial Analyst Extension</p>
