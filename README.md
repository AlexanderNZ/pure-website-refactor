Soldier's 5 Pure CSS Refactor
=============================

I'm currently happy with where the website is currently at. At this stage (21 Mar 15) I consider it feature complete. Unless I need to add pages in the future, it is most likely that the blog will see the majority of changes in terms of new content. That blog is managed through wordpress and not via github - so nothing to see here, move along!

I've really enjoyed it and learned a lot. Eventually I'll refactor again, probably when some cool new web tech comes out that I want to play with.
